Started the weekend updating the Coder server to latest version, and it went surprisingly smoothly.

<!-- excerpt -->

This is the first weekend in a very long time when I have absolutely no plans, and I'm looking forward to just spending some time tinkering on some projects, and getting my dotfiles to a place where I can instantiate a new machine and be able to get up and running.

I'm using [Chezmoi](http://chezmoi.io)to manage the dotfiles, and I'm trying to get the brewfile set up to do an initial install of my applications. The long term goal is to be able to integrate those same dotfiles in Codespaces or my Coder server.

Two other items on the list for this weekend:

1. Get the Steamdeck hard drive upgraded.
2. Read through [Funky Penguin's Geek Cookbook](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz) to get started with Kubernetes on the homelab.

But first Doctor Who. ðŸŸ¦ðŸ’•
