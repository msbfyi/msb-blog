UPDATE: Restoring to the original url structure.

<!-- excerpt -->

Based on some research, I've decided to revert back to the original url structure.

Doing some clean up in preparation of writing more posts.

First up was getting the permalinks to include year, month and date in YYYY/MM/DD format. I'm hoping that this will allow me to add yearly reports and listings soon.

More posts coming soon, including a write up of my /stats page.
