UPDATE: Restoring to the original url structure.

Doing some clean up in preparation of writing more posts.

<!-- excerpt -->

UPDATE: Based on some research, I've decided to revert back to the original url structure.  Source: [Should I Remove the Dates in my Blog URLs? Yes!](https://www.searchenginenews.com/sample/content/should-i-remove-the-dates-in-my-blog-urls-yes))

First up was getting the permalinks to include year, month and date in YYYY/MM/DD format. I'm hoping that this will allow me to add yearly reports and listings soon.

More posts coming soon, including a write up of my /stats page.
