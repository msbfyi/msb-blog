I have a long list of personal project that I want to start tackling, might as well track them here.

<!-- excerpt -->

One of my favorite moments on [The West Wing](https://thetvdb.com/series/the-west-wing) is after all of the action is wrapped up, and someone, usually President Bartlet, asks "What's next?". (With the amount of gifs, podcasts, and books using this title - I feel I'm not only not alone, but this may be a very very basic take. I am what I am.).

In my work, we use issue trackers like Jira or [Linear](https://linear.app) to plan, roadmap, and sequence work. I keep trying to find solutions in my personal information knowledge management to fill the same role without tapping into one of these larger tools.

In no (currently) particular order:

## Home Lab

- Migrate [Plex](https://plex.tv) to new machine
- Reconfigure Raspberry Pi Cluster (maybe move to k3s). Inspiration from [Funky Penguin's Geek Cookbook](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz)
- Move Mastodon into the local network
- Stand up [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org)

## House projects

- Build patio shelters
- Reconfigure the print lab / bedroom
- Purge & Organize storage areas (inside closet, outside closet, and storage containers)
