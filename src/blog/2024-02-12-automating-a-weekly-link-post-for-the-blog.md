Based on the post by [Sophie](https://social.lol/@sophie) on her [blog](https://localghost.dev/blog/automated-weekly-links-posts-with-raindrop-io-and-eleventy/), I'm going to automate a weekly link post. For now going to implement against Raindrop, which I recently migrated my Pocket posts to, and very much liking the interface and workflow so far.
