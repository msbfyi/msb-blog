I'm spacing out my plans for 2025. I want to approach this year as incremental improvements and not huge goals that don't get traction.

To start with I'm going to create Themes that I roll things up to for certain categories.

Here are the categories I'm playing with for now:

- Technical Skills
- Upkeep and maintenance
- Health and Wellness
- Physical Spaces
- Career

I'm going to favor frequency over perfection. Ideally I will have written consistently to the point where it is no longer surprising.
