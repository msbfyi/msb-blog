I'm continuing to gather inspiration from other's on the personal web journey, and tonight I added the basis for my blogroll.

<!-- excerpt -->

I'm taking direct inspiration, and using the fact that [Robb Knight's site](https://rknight.me) is stored in [Github](https://github.com/rknightuk/rknight.me/blob/master/src/pages/blog/blogroll.njk) to use his setup as inspiration for getting my first [Blogroll](https://msb.fyi/blog/roll/) set up.

His write up of his process was the instructions I used to get this configured, so if you're interested in doing this yourself with an Eleventy setup, take a look at [Robb's post](https://rknight.me/blog/creating-an-opml-file-for-my-blogroll/).
