I have followed the Florida Panthers since their 1996 Stanley Cup run, and watching this year made me think, "This could really happen."

This year, I was able to see three games in person: two in Florida and one when the Panthers Played the Kings in LA. Going to the games with my parents became a tradition in 2018 when I flew home right after Barkov was named Captain.

I have three jerseys: 1995-1996, 2018-2019, and 2023-2024 - years 5, 25, and 30. My 30th jersey now has the distinction of being the year they won it all.

My oldest started to really follow the team after the cup run last year, and during a personally challenging April through June, it has been amazing to share this experience with him in the same way my parents shared it with me.

No matter what happens now, the Panthers have finally, FINALLY, won it all.
