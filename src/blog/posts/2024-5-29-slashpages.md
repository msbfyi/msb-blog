New page alert! [/chipotle](/chipotle)

<!-- excerpt -->

Coming back to the tinkering phase of my site, I'm running with the idea I read about first from [Shellsharks](https://shellsharks.com/) that [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/blog/slash-pages/) codified in a new site [slashpages.net](https://slashpages.net/).

I'm starting by moving my /now page into the slashpages director but keeping it top level. My first new page is my Chipotle order. I'm planning on adding what I'm watching and reading similar to the approach that [Cory Dransfeldt](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/building-pages-from-data-in-eleventy/) did. I really like the idea that I'm using apps to enter the tracking data but my site is the cononical source and build my own data set that I use to inform Mastodon instead of linking out to Trakt from my posts. That way I'm not locked into Trakt and I can always keep this site as homebase.

There have been many posts recently around the true social web is the one we used to have where we each had our own space that we linked to, and its exciting to do more little by little. Puttering in the digital garden.
