# Hi there!

I'm a dad of two, semi-regular [podcaster](https://okwhatwentwrong.com), home lab tinkerer, and 
Director of Engineering.

I believe in the open and independent web, and I've been working on this site for the last year
to keep the [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org) spirit alive in me.

You can find me on the web on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@msb), [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/@msb),
and [Github](https://github.com/michaelseanbecker).

**Warning** This site is a constant work in progress and many things will break as I experiment. Built on 11ty.
